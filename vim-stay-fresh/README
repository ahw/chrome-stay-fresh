Vim Stay Fresh
--------------

1. I recommend installing the Vim plugin with Pathogen.
2. Install the Chrome extension.

Local Use
=========
1. The Vim plugin just makes a request to *localhost:7700*, which the Chrome
   extension is listening to. In other words, not further set up is
   required. Click the extension's icon in the browser toolbar.

Remote Use (SSH)
================
1. `ssh your.server.com -R 7700:localhost:7700`
2. The above command will forward all requests made to port 7700 on
   *your.server.com* to your SSH client machine, which will then just
   forward that request to the _client's_ *localhost:7700*.
